### Q: I want to use custom patches for patching my apps. How can I do it?

You should open the folder `Revanced-And-Revanced-Extended-Non-Root/src/patches/`. It contains a lot of folders that are named after the apps you’re patching. Each folder has two files: exclude-patches and include-patches. Edit these files with the patches you like, putting one patch per line, following the patches list here:

* For Revanced: https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches
* For Revanced Extended: https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended
* For Revanced Extended Android 6 & 7: https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/tree/revanced-extended

### Q: I want to use a custom file options.json. How can I do it?

### Q: I am facing errors using your apps, what do I do?

I’m so sorry about this, but my repository only patches apps from “scripts” by other devs. I can’t fix errors when apps face errors, so if you get errors, please make an issue in [Revanced](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches), [Revanced Extended](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended) or [Revanced Extended Android 6 & 7](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/tree/revanced-extended) repositories.

### Q: How do I know these apps are safe to use?

You can rest assured that it’s safe because my code is 100% open-source and uses GitHub Actions to patch the apps. The apk files used for patching are downloaded from the trusted site “APKMirror”.
